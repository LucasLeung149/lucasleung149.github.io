I am currently the class tutor for the Supersymmetry and Supergravity course in the MMathPhys at Oxford for Hilary Term 2026 where I was responsible for presenting problem solutions in class. 

This is an introductory course in supersymmetry, basically following Wess and Bagger.

## A few words about the course

This course is a course on 4d $N=1$ supersymmemtry and its phenomenological consequences. There is a lot of mathematical detail on each part of the course, but the course follows the logical step of introducing:

- Supersymmetry algebra
- Supersymmetric Representations and multiplets
- Superspace formalism
- Supersymmetric actions
- Renormalisation theorems
- Supersymmetry breaking
- Super-Higgs mechanism


## The classes

The classes for this course is run by me on Thursdays and Fridays of Weeks 2,5,6,8. They are held at the Mathematical Institute in room C4 (C5 and C6 for Week 5 Thurs and Fri respectively). Details of sign-up are on the Moodle page.

Let me know if you have any problems.

## Notes and materials
I will publish some class notes (subject to how busy I am) after each class. They will basically include the basic discussion of what I have went through in class.

Health warning: if you aren't mathematically-oriented, please don't read beyond Appendix A.
