I was the teaching assistant for Standard Model and Beyond I in the MMathPhys course at Oxford for Hilary Term 2023 and Hilary Term 2024 where I was responsible to mark the students' scripts and present problem solutions in class. This is an advanced course in QFT introducing the Standard Model to students in their final term.
