I was the teaching assistant for String Theory I in the MMathPhys course at Oxford for Hilary Term 2023 and Hilary Term 2024 where I was responsible to mark the students' scripts and present problem solutions in class. This is an introductory course in string theory where the concepts in bosonic string theory, D-branes and T-dualities are introduced.
