Broadly speaking, my main research interests lie in the intersection between theoretical physics (string theory and quantum gravity), pure mathematics and machine learning. 

One of the problems that have confused many generations of theoretical physicists is whether there exists a theory that describes all the phenomenon we know - this is typically known as the 'theory of everything'. Over the past century, the leading theory that describes three of the four fundamnetal forces, namely electromagnetic, strong and weak force, and the fundamental building blocks of matter, is the Standard Model. This is a Quantum Field Theory that describes particles as excitations in a quantum-mechanical field theory.

Einstein's theory of gravity, in which matter is described as sources that curve spacetime, is well developed. It is however extremely difficult to combine the gravitational force with the Standard Model. Theories that consistently combine both theories and can describe all four fundamental forces are known as Quantum Gravity theories (QG).

This is where string theory comes in - it is the only consistent Quantum Gravity (QG) model that mathematicians and physicists can study and manipulate. Whilst many debate about its difficulty to be tested experimentally, the subfield of String Phenomenology has been developed over the past three decades to address the potential observational issues and difficulties of string theory, and to satisfy all particle and cosmological observations to make quantifiable predictions. Doing this is useful - not only can we find out ways to test string theory in quantifiable observations, but working in a consistent string theory framework where the mathematics is under better control also allows us to figure out how different changing different 'nuts and bolts' in a high energy, UV-complete theory, will affect low-energy theory, observations and phenomenology.

The most exciting development in the past decade was the inception of using data science techniques to address theoretical issues in string theory. Heuristic search methods such as genetic algorithms (GA) as well as machine learning methods like reinforcement learning (RL) have been applied to a variety of mathematical and theoretical physics problems, leading to new predictions and results such as the computation of Yukawa couplings (i.e. masses of fundamental particles such as quarks and electrons) from heterotic string theory.

I am interested in a wide range of topics in the intersection between string theory with ML and geometry. Here are some of my current research topics that I am currently investigating.

String Model Building (using Machine Learning)
======
One could ask the question - is it possible to extract the Standard Model as a low-energy theory of string theory? To answer that is highly-nontrivial - string theory (as well as M-theory, F-theory) works in ten or more dimensions and since we only observe four dimensions at low-energies (3 spatial dimensions and 1 time dimension), we must 'hide' the six dimensions that we don't see by saying they are very small, wrapped up manifolds. This is called 'compactification' and typically this requires picking manifolds with particular topological and geometrical properties (Calabi-Yau manifolds) to obtain the correct low-energy spectrum and couplings.

There is a very high number of topological and geometrical choices that will lead to the Standard Model. This is known as the string landscape - and we can use machine learning techniques to help us look for correct choices in this vast parameter space. For example, we can use genetic algorithms to look for string theories with matter taking correct charges in some symmetry that will give correct mass data at low-energies.

I currently mainly work with the heterotic $E_8 \times E_8$ theory, but these techniques can be similarly generalised to analyse under string theory models, such as Type IIB orientifold compactifications, F-theory models, as so on.
