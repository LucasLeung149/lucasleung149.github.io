Broadly speaking, my main research interests lie in the intersection between theoretical physics (string theory and quantum gravity), pure mathematics and machine learning.

String theory remains the only consistent Quantum Gravity (QG) model that mathematicians and physicists can study and manipulate. Our group is interested in obtaining viable models directly from superstring theory, ultilising a technique called 'string compactification'. Namely, we reduce the ten-dimensions in superstring theory down to four-dimensions where we reside. The six-dimensions, known as the 'compactifified' dimensions, have specific topological and geometrical properties which determine the low-energy (real-world) data. Currently, I am mainly interested in the details of non-pertubative effects that arise in heterotic E8xE8 string compactifications on line bundles of CICYs, as well as ultilising Data Science techniques to search through viable models that can appear in heterotic compactifications.

I am interested in a wide range of topics - some of my current research topics can be found below.
