## About me

I am a fourth-year graduate student under the supervision of Prof Andre Lukas. My current interests include string phenomenology and string model building, applications of data science techniques and machine learning in string theory, as well as algorithmic algebraic geometry and applications in string model building.

My DPhil studies has been funded by the Croucher Foundation. My bio on their website can be found at https://scholars.croucher.org.hk/scholars/leung-lucas-tsun-yin.

## Research

I am a string theorist - I am basically (much shorter and more autistic version) like Sheldon Cooper from Big Bang Theory.
I work in the intersection between string theory, machine learning and geometry. Click on my Research tab for more details.
My recent publications and talks can also be found in the relevant tabs.

## Teaching

I am currently teaching Groups and Representations of the MMathPhys course at Oxford and second-year Mathematical Methods at Mansfield. Click on Teaching for the details and for past courses.

## Fun Stuff when I am not studying

When I am not thinking about maths you will find me training with people. I used to be the captain for the triathlon team at Oxford.
I also used to compose music - I am a pianist and a percussionist. Music by Brahms, Tchaikovsky and Mahler is the best.
