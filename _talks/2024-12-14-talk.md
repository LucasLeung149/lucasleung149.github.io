This is a talk on my paper 'Fermion Masses and Mixings in String-inspired models' in the annual conference String Data in Kyoto, Japan, where I have shared some of the final results on our paper searching for low-energy models using symmetries in string theory and genetic algorithms.

The slides of this talk can be found [here](https://lucasleung149.github.io/files/string_data_2024_final.pdf).
