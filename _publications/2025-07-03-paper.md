excerpt: 'Deriving the Yukawa couplings and the resulting fermion masses and mixing angles of the Standard Model (SM) from a more fundamental theory remains one of the central outstanding problems in theoretical high-energy physics. It has long been recognised that string theory provides a framework within which this question can, at least in principle, be addressed.'
