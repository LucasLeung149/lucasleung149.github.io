title: "Reproducing Standard Model Fermion Masses and Mixing in String Theory: A Heterotic Line Bundle Study"
collection: publications

permalink: /publication/2410-17704
excerpt: 'Deriving the Yukawa couplings and the resulting fermion masses and mixing angles of the Standard Model (SM) from a more fundamental theory remains one of the central outstanding problems in theoretical high-energy physics. It has long been recognised that string theory provides a framework within which this question can, at least in principle, be addressed.'
