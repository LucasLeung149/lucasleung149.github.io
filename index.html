                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am currently a graduate student in the Particle Theory group of the Department of Physics at Oxford under the supervision
                        of Professor Andre Lukas. I was previously a student at the University of Cambridge, having completed Parts I and II of
                        Natural Sciences Tripos (NST) and Part III of Mathematical Tripos.
                        Here is my <a href="https://tyl40.user.srcf.net/lucas_leung_cv.pdf">CV</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <h3>Current Research</h3>
                    <p>
                        Broadly speaking, my main research interests lie in the intersection of mathematics and physics. The particular area I am mostly
                        involved in is something known as "String Phemenology". This involves using algberaic and differntial geometric techniques to obtain
                        vaible phemenological models of the Standard Model from string theory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        String theory remains the only constructed Quantum Gravity (QG) model that mathematicians and physicists can study and manipulate.
                        Our group is interested in obtaining viable models directly from superstring theory, in a technique called string compactification.
                        This involves reducing the ten dimensions in superstring theory to the four-dimensions we see in our daily life with some hidden dimensional
                        constructions known as Calabi-Yau manifolds. Currently, I am mainly interested in the details of non-pertubative effects that arise in heterotic E8xE8
                        string compactifications on line bundles of CICYs, as well as ultilising Machine Learning (ML) techniques to search through viable models
                        that can appear in heterotic compactifications.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Reading Group</h2>
                    <p>
                        In Hilary 2023 Ethan Carragher, Davide Laurenzano, Martin Mosny and I are organising a reading group on AdS/CFT. The reading group page can be found
                        <a href="https://lucasleung149.github.io/reading_group/">here</a>.

                    <h2>Teaching</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am currently not teaching this term.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Hilary 2023 I am the teaching assistant (TA) for Strings I.
                        In Michaelmas 2022 I was a tutor for Groups and Representations.
                    </p>
                    



                    <h2>Past Research</h2>
                    <p>I previously completed a project with Dr Michal Kwasigroch, a temporary college lecturer in Trinity on
                        Mean Field Theory analysis of RKKY and Kodo interactions in a Kondo lattice. 
                        A temporary detailed report can be 
                        found <a href="https://tyl40.user.srcf.net/kondo_report_oct2021.pdf">here</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>In 2020 I did a summer poject on lubricated icesheet perturbation analysis with Dr Katarzyna Kowal in DAMTP.
                        A short report can be found <a href="https://tyl40.user.srcf.net/fluid_report_pub.pdf">here</a>.

                    <p>In the summer of 2020 I taught a short course in my secondary school on Newtonian
                        physics and some mathematical techniques. The course book can be found in the
                        link below:

                        </p>

                    <p>I was also the tutor and then the advisor for the student-run QCPhO Training Course from 2015-2017.
                        Some notes that I have made throughtout the years can be found below.

                    <p>I have been helping (unofficially) students in my secondary school in their DSE preparation during
                        the COVID-19 pandemic. Here are some useful resources.

                    <p>I am an enthusiastic triathlete (and perhaps one of the only asian faces in the club...)! I am heavily involed in the Oxford University Triathlon Club 
                        and am the Treasurer in year 2023-24. Our club webpage can be found <a href="https://www.outric.co.uk">here</a>.

                    <p>I did an Undertale Medley arrangement for an ensemble when I was in Cambridge. I had arranged
                        and orchestrated the pieces we are going to perform.
