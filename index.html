                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am currently a graduate student in the Particle Theory group of the Department of Physics at Oxford under the supervision
                        of Professor Andre Lukas. I was previously a student at the University of Cambridge, having completed Parts I and II of
                        Natural Sciences Tripos (NST) and Part III of Mathematical Tripos.
                        Here is my <a href="https://tyl40.user.srcf.net/lucas_leung_cv.pdf">CV</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Research</h2>
                    <h3>Current Research</h3>
                    <p>
                        Broadly speaking, my main research interests lie in the intersection of mathematics and physics. 
                    </p>


                    <h3>Past Research</h3>
                    <p>I previously completed a project with Dr Michal Kwasigroch, a temporary college lecturer in Trinity on
                        Mean Field Theory analysis of RKKY and Kodo interactions in a Kondo lattice. 
                        A temporary detailed report can be 
                        found <a href="https://tyl40.user.srcf.net/kondo_report_oct2021.pdf">here</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>In 2020 I did a summer poject on lubricated icesheet perturbation analysis with Dr Katarzyna Kowal in DAMTP.
                        A short report can be found <a href="https://tyl40.user.srcf.net/fluid_report_pub.pdf">here</a>.

                    <h3>QCPhO Training materials</h3>
                    <p>In the summer of 2020 I taught a short course in my secondary school on Newtonian
                        physics and some mathematical techniques. The course book can be found in the
                        link below:

                        Problem Book on Classical Mechanics</a>
                        </p>

                    <p>I was also the tutor and then the advisor for the student-run QCPhO Training Course from 2015-2017.
                        Some notes that I have made throughtout the years can be found below.

                    <h3>DSE Physics</h3>
                    <p>I have been helping (unofficially) students in my secondary school in their DSE preparation during
                        the COVID-19 pandemic. Here are some useful resources.

                    <p>I am also doing an Undertale Medley arrangement for an ensemble with my friends. I have arranged
                        and orchestrated the pieces we are going to perform.
